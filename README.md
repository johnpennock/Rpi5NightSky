# Rpi5NightSky
Scripts for Raspberry Pi night sky photo captures

I setup a Raspberry Pi 5 with an SSD and decided to try taking photos / videos of the stars.  We have a place that's in a dark sky area, and you can see so many stars, but I wanted to try to actually get photos of them.  My Pixel does a really good job, but I wanted something I could leave out and come back in the morning.  This seems to work pretty well, now just need to tweak the settings, and figure out where to point it.

Here are the parts that I purchased:
Raspberry Pi 5 8GB RAM
Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT+ (For Raspberry Pi 5)
Raspberry Pi SSD 256GB
27W -5V/5A Raspberry Pi 5 Compatible USB-C Power Supply

Tilt Adjustable Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 Mount
Amazon Basics Lightweight Mini Tripod, Black2
CSI FPC Flexible Cable For Raspberry Pi 5, 22Pin To 15Pin, 0.5 M Length
